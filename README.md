## [![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/andreasgrv/mlconf.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/andreasgrv/mlconf) mlconf 

Because in machine learning sensible defaults don't last long. Especially when choosing
hyperparameters:

<!-- scrat loves acorns -->

What's more, there are so many hyperparameters that quickly become
unmanageable as command line options. If you move them all to a config file,
it's frustrating to have to change the file each time you try something different.
So why not enjoy the best of both worlds?

**Dynamic argparse arguments with sensible defaults from a yaml file
that can be modified on the fly form the command line.**

### mlconf in a nutshell

* Dynamically set a lot of sane defaults from a [YAML](http://yaml.org) file.
* Be able to override any number of the defaults from the command line.
* Make the returned object easily accessible using . notation.
* Allows for instantiation of classes with reflection using the $classname
and $module parameters at a later time by using the blueprint's *build()* command.
